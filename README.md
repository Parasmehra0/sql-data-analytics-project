# Ad-Hoc analysis sql

In this project, I will perform SQL queries to extract meaningful insights like measures and metrics, time-based trends, cumulative analytics from a structured database consisting of three key tables: 

gold_fact_sales
  The gold_fact_sales table stores transactional data, including order details, product keys, and customer keys.

gold_dim_products
  The gold_dim_products table contains product-related attributes such as category, product name, and cost.

gold_report_customers.
  The gold_report_customers table holds customer information, including customer segmentation, average order value, and last order date.
